  |   Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with         |
  |   unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit.     |
  |   In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal.      |
  |   The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now,    |
  |   with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in     |
  |   the League for challenge and respect.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You    |
  |   can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your         |
  |   character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds   |
  |   up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme     |
  |   velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high     |
  |   speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with       |
  |   friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle     |
  |   it out online!                                                        |
  |                                                                         |

  |   After Dust found his way back to Shine City from his unfinal          |
  |   resting place, he quickly made contact with the Queen of the          |
  |   streets, aka Toxic. Toxic, in her generosity, explained the ins and   |
  |   outs of the Lethal League to him. Having lost his memory and          |
  |   identity, his only possession was an enigmatic note that he found     |
  |   in one of his sneakers. The info on it led him to seek out            |
  |   prosecuting officials at a pension costume party. So originated the   |
  |   Master of the Mountain persona.                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - The Master of the Mountain colorway. An orange-black                |
  |   mountaineering inspired look with the classic red mask.               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - The Master of the Plains colorway. An off white desert nomad        |
  |   inspired look with a black mask.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - A special bird-of-legend version of Ashes for both colorways.       |
  |                                                                         |
